PROBLEM:

Given a string s consisting of small English letters, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '_'.

Example

For s = "abacabad", the output should be
first_not_repeating_character(s) = 'c'.

There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c since it appears in the string first.

For s = "abacabaabacaba", the output should be
first_not_repeating_character(s) = '_'.

There are no characters in this string that do not repeat.



SOLUTION:

def first_not_repeating_character(s):
    
    chars=[]
    matches={}

    for letter in s:
        if letter in matches:
            matches[letter]+=1
        else:
            matches[letter]=1
            chars.append(letter)
    for letter in chars:
        if matches[letter] ==1:
            return letter
    return '_'
