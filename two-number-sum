PROBLEM:

Write a function that takes a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order. If no two numbers sum up to target sum, function should return an empty array. 
Note that the target sum must be obtained by summing two different integers in the array, you cant add a single integer to itself in order to get the target sum.'
You can assume there will be at one pair of numbers summing up to target sum.

Sample Input:
array=[3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6]
targetSum=10

Sample Output:
[-1, 11]




SOLUTION:

def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum):
    # Write your code here.
	numbers={}
	
	for num in array:
		x = targetSum - num
		if x in numbers:
			return [x, num]
		else:
			numbers[num]=True
	return []
